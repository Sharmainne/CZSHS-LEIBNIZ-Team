# Introduction
    This is the official engineering documentation of the Cielito Zamora Senior High School (CZSHS) LEIBNIZ Team for the Philippine Robot Olympiad (PRO) 2025 in the Future Engineers Category. Our project, centered around the theme Future of the Engineers, explores the boundless potential of robotics in shaping the future of engineering and technology. In this documentation, we present our self-driving car project, an innovative leap into autonomous systems. As we build this robot, we explore not only the technologies behind self-driving vehicles but also the profound impact they will have on engineering, mobility, and society as a whole. From autonomous navigation to advanced sensor integration, this project blends robotics, machine learning, and engineering principles to create a system that learns, adapts, and performs in dynamic environments. 
    This gives key aspects of the CZSHS LEIBNIZ Team robot’s development. We delve into the robot's design, development processes, and technical specifications, offering insights into the robotic technologies that drive its autonomous capabilities. These technologies include object detection, real-time decision-making, sensor fusion, and machine learning algorithms, all of which form the backbone of a fully autonomous vehicle. Our project is more than just a robotic self-driving car; it is a vision for the future of robotics, where engineers are tasked with creating smarter, more efficient systems that can redefine how we interact with technology and the world around us. Through this work, we demonstrate our commitment to advancing the field of robotics and autonomous technology, striving to push the boundaries of what robots can achieve.

# Main Robot Specifications

# history of Vehicle design
# 1.First Vehicle Design 
    The image shows the first draft of a LEGO-based robotic vehicle built using LEGO Education SPIKE Prime components. The robot includes a large hub with a battery, which is vertically mounted in the center of the structure and connected with ribbon cables. It also features a medium motor and a large motor, likely used to control the wheels and steering mechanisms. Additionally, the robot is equipped with ultrasonic sensors, which are typically used for distance measurement and obstacle detection. These sensors are positioned infront of the robot to enable environmental awareness, possibly for tasks like object avoidance or autonomous navigation.

## 1.1. Power Management 
       In a robotics system, power management is the absolutely critical discipline that intelligently handles every face of electrical energy. This means meticulously acquiring power (whether from robust batteries, a steady wall connection, or even by cleverly regenerating it), precisely distributing it to every single component—from the powerful motors and sensitive sensors to the robot's very brain—and, most importantly, relentlessly optimizing its use. This relentless optimization is what guarantees the robot operates with maximum efficiency, unwavering reliability, and for the absolute longest possible duration.
### SPIKE™ Large Hub
    The SPIKE™ Large Hub is the central, programmable "brain" of the LEGO Education SPIKE Prime robotics system. This brick-shaped device features six input/output ports for connecting sensors and motors, Bluetooth and micro USB connectivity, a built-in 6-axis gyro sensor, a 5x5 light matrix, and a speaker. Powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, it runs on MicroPython, making it versatile for all coding levels. It integrates seamlessly with LEGO building elements, serving as the core component for hands-on robotics and coding education. The team chose this as the controller for the first vehicle since it's advanced yet user-friendly and more appropriate to use.
### SPIKE™ Large Hub Rechargeable Battery
    The SPIKE™ Large Hub Rechargeable lithium-ion battery is a custom 2100 mAh, 7.3V power source designed exclusively for the LEGO Education SPIKE Prime Large Hub. This high-capacity battery fits directly into the Hub and charges via a micro USB cable (taking 2-5 hours depending on the charger). It's easily removable without tools, boasts a lifespan of over 500 charge cycles, and is included with the SPIKE Prime set, though also available as a replacement. It's crucial for powering the Hub's robotics and coding functions.
