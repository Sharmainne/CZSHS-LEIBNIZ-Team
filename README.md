# Introduction
    This is the official engineering documentation of the Cielito Zamora Senior High School (CZSHS) LEIBNIZ Team for the Philippine Robot Olympiad (PRO) 2025 in the Future Engineers Category. Our project, centered around the theme Future of the Engineers, explores the boundless potential of robotics in shaping the future of engineering and technology. In this documentation, we present our self-driving car project, an innovative leap into autonomous systems. As we build this robot, we explore not only the technologies behind self-driving vehicles but also the profound impact they will have on engineering, mobility, and society as a whole. From autonomous navigation to advanced sensor integration, this project blends robotics, machine learning, and engineering principles to create a system that learns, adapts, and performs in dynamic environments. 
    This gives key aspects of the CZSHS LEIBNIZ Team robot’s development. We delve into the robot's design, development processes, and technical specifications, offering insights into the robotic technologies that drive its autonomous capabilities. These technologies include object detection, real-time decision-making, sensor fusion, and machine learning algorithms, all of which form the backbone of a fully autonomous vehicle. Our project is more than just a robotic self-driving car; it is a vision for the future of robotics, where engineers are tasked with creating smarter, more efficient systems that can redefine how we interact with technology and the world around us. Through this work, we demonstrate our commitment to advancing the field of robotics and autonomous technology, striving to push the boundaries of what robots can achieve.

# Main Robot Specifications

# 1. Mobility Management
        In the Mobility management this are refers to the process of maintaining uninterrupted connectivity or access to a moving object. In telecommunications, it enables call/data transparency through monitoring device location and network handovers. For robotics, it is the capability of a robot to move autonomously, such as localization, mapping, path planning, and avoidance of obstacles, to preserve operational objectives during movement.

# 2. Power and Sense Management
## 2.1. Power Management 
    Power management for robotics is the fundamental function of effectively governing, distributing, and optimizing a robot's electrical power. It means keeping track of and charging the power source safely, managing and distributing power to all devices, and actively minimizing energy usage through mechanisms such as sleep modes or dynamic power management. Its key significance is in maximizing autonomy, achieving stable performance, extending component life, and assuring the robot's safe use.

## 2.2. Sense Management
    Sense management in robotics is the holistic process of acquiring, processing, interpreting, and utilizing data from a robot's multitude of sensors in order to know its surroundings and internal state. It encompasses sensor data acquisition, sensor fusion (integration of data across multiple sensors), data processing (filtering, calibration), perception (detection, localization, mapping), and finally, information utilization to drive the robot's control and decision-making mechanisms. It is important for autonomy, safety, task execution, and robustness
