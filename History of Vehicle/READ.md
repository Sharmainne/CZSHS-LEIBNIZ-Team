# Version 1
  The first version of the vehicle focused on conceptualizing a robot that could be used for autonomous tasks. The team also concentrated on enabling turns with a 180-degree rotation. The team chose the LEGO Education SPIKE Prime as the vehicle's brain due to its robust capabilities. Since the vehicle was only equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, it was capable of detecting traffic signs or obstacles based on proximity. However, due to the team's lack of utilization of a camera and color sensor, The robot was unable to overcome the open obstacle, a limitation stemming from its ability to only detect blocks immediately in front and to its sides.

# Version 2 
  The second version of the vehicle, the team changed the components for more convenient use. They utilized the 'AI Steam 101S Controller' as the robot's brain, the 'AI Steam 101S Lithium Battery Module' for power, the 'AI Steam 101S Camera' as a sensor for the vehicle, and lastly, the 'AI STEAM 101S Simulated Steering Gear Module' for the front wheels and the 'AI STEAM 101S Ordinary Motor Module' for the back of the robot. However, the team primarily focused on getting the camera to work and increasing the wheel speed to enable the vehicle to rotate throughout the entire map. While the team successfully achieved this, they encountered a struggle with the robot because the current vehicle's camera became inconsistent, and the team also realized that the vehicle needed a gyroscope.
