# Version 1
  The first version of the vehicle focused on conceptualizing a robot that could be used for autonomous tasks. The team also concentrated on enabling turns with a 180-degree rotation. The team chose the LEGO Education SPIKE Prime as the vehicle's brain due to its robust capabilities. Since the vehicle was only equipped with an ultrasonic sensor, it was capable of detecting traffic signs or obstacles based on proximity. However, because the team did not utilize a camera or color sensor, it was unable to handle obstacles that were differentiated by color.
